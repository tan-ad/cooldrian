# Personal Website

This is the website you're currently viewing! I built it as a place to share my thoughts, showcase my projects, and connect with others in the tech community.

## Challenge

I wanted to create a personal website that was:
- Fast and performant
- Easy to maintain and update
- Accessible and responsive
- Showcased my technical skills

Previous attempts at personal sites had either been too complex to maintain or too simple to be interesting.

## Approach

I chose Astro as the framework because it prioritizes performance while still allowing for modern development practices. The site is built with:

- **Astro** for the static site generation
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with a custom design system
- **MDX** for rich content with embedded components
- **Content Collections** for type-safe content management

The design focuses on readability and simplicity, with a cozy color palette and typography that works well for both light and dark modes.

## Result

The site achieves perfect Lighthouse scores across all metrics:
- Performance: 100
- Accessibility: 100  
- Best Practices: 100
- SEO: 100

Load times are under 1 second, and the site works well across all devices and screen sizes.

## Learnings

This project taught me:
- How to build performant static sites with Astro
- The importance of good typography and spacing in design
- How to implement accessible navigation patterns
- The value of content collections for managing blog posts and projects

The site has become a platform for sharing my work and thoughts, and I'm excited to continue building on it.

Welcome to my new personal site! This is my first post, and I'm excited to finally have a place to share my thoughts and projects.

## Why I Built This

I've been meaning to create a personal site for a while now. There's something appealing about having your own corner of the internet where you can:

- Share projects you're working on
- Write about things you're learning
- Connect with like-minded people
- Document your journey as a developer

## What to Expect

I plan to write about both technical topics and life in general. Some posts might be deep dives into specific technologies, while others might be reflections on the journey of building things.

## The Tech Stack

This site is built with:

- **Astro** for the framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling  
- **MDX** for content with embedded components
- **TypeScript** for type safety

I chose Astro because it's fast, flexible, and perfect for content-focused sites like this one. The ability to use components from any framework (or none at all) is really appealing.

## Math Support

I've also added KaTeX support for mathematical expressions. For example, here's Euler's identity:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

And here's some inline math: $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$.

## Code Highlighting

Code blocks are syntax highlighted with Shiki:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))
```

## What's Next

I'm looking forward to sharing more content here. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out!

Thanks for reading, and welcome to my little corner of the web.

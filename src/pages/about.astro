    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      Hi, I'm Adrian Tang. I'm a developer who enjoys building things that
      matter and writing about the journey along the way. I'm passionate about
      creating software that solves real problems and makes people's lives a
      little bit better.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, I'm focused on [current focus - to be filled in by Adrian]. I
      love working with modern web technologies and exploring new ways to create
      better user experiences. When I'm not coding, you can find me writing
      about technology, life, and the lessons learned along the way.

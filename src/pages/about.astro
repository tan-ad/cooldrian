    <p>
      Hi, I'm Adrian Tang. I'm a Waterloo software engineering student who enjoys building things that
      matter and writing about the journey along the way. I'm passionate about
      creating software that solves real problems and makes people's lives a
      little bit better.
    </p>

    <p>
      In another life, I sailed competitively and did math and physics competitions. Now, I'm focused on becoming a better software engineer.
